# 🧠📈 Multi-Agent Stock Trading System
The Repository contain an Assignment and a small Project related to Multi-Agent Stock Trading System.
A collaborative AI driven simulation of intelligent trading behaviors using Naive Bayes classification, K-Means clustering, and a multi agent framework. Developed as part of the **Applied Artificial Intelligence** course at FAST NUCES.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The stock market is an ever-evolving ecosystem affected by countless dynamic variables. Traditional rule-based systems often fall short when adapting to real-time changes in market conditions. This project explores how **multiple AI techniques** can be orchestrated to create a more adaptive and intelligent stock trading system.

Our system simulates agents with specialized AI roles working together to:
- Predict market trends
- Cluster similar stock conditions
- Coordinate trading decisions collaboratively

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 **Predict Stock Movements**: Use Naive Bayes to classify whether stock prices will go up or down.
- 📊 **Cluster Stocks**: Use K-Means clustering to group stocks with similar behavior or conditions.
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Design a system where agents interact, share information, and evaluate each other based on performance metrics.

## 🧩 System Architecture

1. **Naive Bayes Agent**  
   Predicts market trends (Up/Down) based on historical stock features.

2. **Clustering Agent**  
   Groups similar stocks or market conditions using K-Means.

3. **Coordinator Agent / Environment**  
   Oversees agent interactions, decision-making, and performance evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `yfinance`
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- ✅ A functional AI based prototype for stock trading simulation.
- 📉 Comparative performance evaluation of AI agent strategies.
- 📖 Final report including:
  - Visualizations
  - Analysis of each agent’s role and contribution
  - Insights on the collaborative nature of AI in finance
